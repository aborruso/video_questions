# Project Overview

This project is a command-line tool named **QV** that allows users to ask questions about a YouTube video and receive answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). It fetches the video's subtitles, uses them as context, and passes the user's question to an LLM to generate a response.

The primary technologies used are:
*   **Shell Scripting (Bash):** The main entry point is a shell script (`scripts/qv.sh`).
*   **Python:** A helper script (`scripts/qv.py`) is used for processing the subtitles.
*   **yt-dlp:** A command-line program to download video subtitles from YouTube.
*   **llm:** A command-line tool for interacting with large language models.
*   **jq:** A command-line JSON processor.

# Building and Running

This project does not require a build process. It is a collection of scripts that are run directly.

## Running the application

The main script can be run from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
./scripts/qv.sh <YouTube URL> "<Question>" [OPTIONS]
```

**Example:**

```bash
./scripts/qv.sh "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo" "What are the main topics covered in this video?"
```

## Dependencies

The following command-line tools must be installed and available in the system's `PATH`:
*   `yt-dlp`
*   `curl`
*   `llm`
*   `jq`

# Development Conventions

Based on the existing files, the following conventions are in place:

*   **Language:** All documentation, comments, and other text-based content should be written in English.
*   **Shell Scripting:** The main logic is contained in `scripts/qv.sh`. It is well-documented with comments and usage instructions.
*   **Python Scripting:** A helper Python script `scripts/qv.py` is used for subtitle processing.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md`: Provides a general overview and installation instructions.
    *   `PRD.md`: A Product Requirements Document outlines the project's goals, features, and target audience.
    *   `idee.md`: A document containing ideas for future enhancements.
    *   `LOG.md`: A log of important decisions and project progress.
*   **Git:** The project uses Git for version control. A `.gitignore` file is present to exclude unnecessary files.
